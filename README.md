# Accounting with MaxMSP

Being a freelancer with a sole proprietorship, I usually end up with a zillion screenshots, pdf´s and photos of various reciepts and invoices every turn of the year. HDJSAJ is a tool which can aid freelancers and small companies working in Norway with filling out the [Income statement 1](https://www.skatteetaten.no/en/forms/income-statement-1/) ([næringsoppgave 1](https://www.skatteetaten.no/skjema/naringsoppgave-1/)) RF-1175, by using image file names to generate .csv spreadsheets.
