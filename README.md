# Accounting with MaxMSP

This is a tool which can aid norwegian based freelancers and small business owners to fill out their [Income statement 1](https://www.skatteetaten.no/en/forms/income-statement-1/) ([næringsoppgave 1](https://www.skatteetaten.no/skjema/naringsoppgave-1/)) RF-1175, by using image file names to generate spreadsheets.

Being a freelancer with sole proprietorship, I usually end up with a zillion screenshots, pdf´s and photos of reciepts and invoices every turn of the year. I therefore made this app to help organize and streamline my accounting in accordance with the RF-1175 operating income and cost sections 9910 and 9900.

## How to use

Generating spreadsheets by analyzing image file names requires a system of labeling. Every reciept and invoice has the same syntax and labeling "code":

* "01.26.19 3400 430kr.pdf"



and the income and operating cost categories from RF-1175, specifically from 9910 and 9900. 

1. Specific file names. (kategorier)

2. Import folder into app

3. Click "eksporter". .csv format in source folder.
