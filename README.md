# Accounting with MaxMSP

Work in progress.

Being a freelancer with a sole proprietorship, I usually end up with a zillion screenshots, pdf´s and photos of various reciepts and invoices every turn of the year. HDJSAJ is a tool which can aid freelancers and small companies working in Norway with e-reciept management and filling out the Income statement 1 (RF-1175 næringsoppgave 1), by using images file names to generate income and expense spreadsheets.
